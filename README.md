### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up - The top level has been split into four main functional areas - Hardware, Firmware, MobileApp and Backend. Place your code into the appropriate subdirectories, and please create a subdirectory container for your code. For example, add an Android subdirectory under MobileApp and add your code there, or create PHP and SQL subdirectories, and place your PHP and SQL creation scripts in their respective locations.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Now that we're moving along with coding, we need to incorporate some standard development procedures like code reviews for code stability. 

In order to do that, we're moving to a fork-and-pull method. It is quite simple really - you can read more about it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) and/or [here](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/contribute-to-bitbucket-projects-using-forks-and-pull-requests/) :
* No one directly commits to the master branch. 
* Everyone creates his/her own fork/branch off the main branch (master)
* You then clone the fork (just like you cloned the main branch)
* You work on your changes.
* You commit them as you go along. All your changes go to the fork/branch.
* When you are done, you issue a pull request.
* This initiates a code review - people can view your changes and comment on them. Based on feedback, you may have to make additional modifications to your changes, and submit them again, and issue another pull request. 
* Once all the code changes have been reviewed and accepted, the admin will then pull the changes from the fork into the main branch.

The advantage of this approach is that it facilitates code review, where people can easily see the "diff" of your changes and be able to comment on them. 

If you have any questions on the approach or would like a runthrough/demo, let me know!
