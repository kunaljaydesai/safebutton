I've split the top level directories to the 4 main functional areas - Hardware, Firmware, MobileApp and Backend. 

Please start using the repository and put your code into the appropriate directories. When you do so, please create a subdirectory container (for example, Android subdirectory in MobileApp, and add your code there, or create PHP and SQL directories for the PHP and SQL creation scripts respectively). 

Thanks,
Sridhar
